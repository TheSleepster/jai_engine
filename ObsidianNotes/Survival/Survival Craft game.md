## Concept and Genre
Starting draft of the main features are as follows. Much like in Stardew Valley, Core Keeper, and Terraria you will start in a fresh world. This World will have different biomes that have different weather systems and perhaps environmental dangers. For example, you may have a snow biome that you must craft special armor to help steel yourself against the cold to explore further. Risks of avalanches or quicksand are things that the player should expect when exploring the different biomes.

The goal of the player spawning in would be to gather certain items like power cores to give the player special abilities or enhance base stats. These cores would be obtained by defeating "Guardians" which would essentially be bosses. Perhaps some inspired by Terraria's "Calamity" mod. Before the player could obtain these cores however, they would need to explore the world to find resources, artifacts, and the boss's dungeon. The resources and the artifacts would be necessary to access the boss's area and fight it.

# Visual Style
The game will have a 2D Top-Down Pixel Art Style to it. A visual style inspired by games like Core Keeper and Dead Cells. Dead Cells and Core Keeper make use of the 3D animation in their sprite animation, I intend to do the same. Either by Loading 3D models directly into the world and scaling them with shaders to make them appear as 2D, or by using a software that will turn 3D animations and characters into 2D sprite sheets. 

The environments will also be created using pixel art, likely 16x16 tile sizes for uniformity. However, the sizes may very depending on the underlying circumstances.
As for the stylization of the maps, I intend for the environments to be very 2D Zelda-like. Structures like cliffs and such such will be common place in biomes.

# Interesting Mechanics
The game loop will be inspired by games like Stardew Valley in the way that there is farming and combat, with expansive and interesting exploration. The rest will be exploring and crafting items that the player needs. Plants can be used to craft food and potions. Enemies will be plentiful and dangerous with a deep combat system to back. The Combat System would include things like dodging, parrying, magic potentially, and a skill tree to bring it all together. 

# Influences and Inspiration
As previously stated this game takes a lot of inspiration from games such as Terarria, Forager, Stardew Valley, Core Keeper, and Dead Cells.

The elements I want to pull from these games vary, I wish to pull each of their unique elements into a unique and fun game. The largest amount of inspiration for the game loop comes from Forager and Core Keeper. The largest amount of inspiration for the art style comes from Dead Cells. It's unique usage of 3D model animation to sprite sheets allows for the game to have a unique look and feel to it that I wish to replicate.

1. From Terarria I wish to pull the boss loop from it. The Loop of gathering items and resources to build up to fighting a boss, then defeating it allowing you to grow beyond the level you were capped at before the fight. Continuing until there are none left to defeat. Terraria also makes use of the "world evils" to change the environment, I intend do something similar.

2. From Forager, I like the elements of the game loop. The game loop is similar to that of Stardew, but without the village life. Which is pretty much the same thing that I want to go for. In Forager the player harvests resources, clears dungeons with difficult bosses, and grows their island by using the money they earn to expand their territory. I intend to use the combat and crafting to make the game more interesting. From what negative reviews I read, the game is too grindy for most people. Therefore, I will try not to create the same issue.

3. Core Keeper and Terraria make use of different classes of weapons to allow for diversity in the players arsenal. I intend to stick with this idea. Allowing the player to gather resources and get special drops from bosses to expand the players choices in defeating bosses and clearing dungeons. The skill trees will be to add more choices for the player while making the game more interesting.
